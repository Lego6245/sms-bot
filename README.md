# SMS-BOT

First of all, this bot was created by [@Yhatoh](https://github.com/Yhatoh) and [@storrealbac](https://github.com/storrealbac/).

This bot will create and update events each hour depending on the database's data.

There is one important variable called `NAME_DB`, which contains the name of the database (in case there is another season, just change it). Future work: make this variable updateable from discord.

Also, this bot assumes voice chats in the server will not change in the next years :) .

To start the bot, just run `npm run start`.
